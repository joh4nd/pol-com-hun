TODO:
- address problems (below)
- setup working comment bot e.g. https://github.com/redianmarku/YouTube-Bot, https://github.com/redianmarku/YT-Comment-Bot
- pipe msgs to google translate for English <-> Hungarian translation
- setup youtube searcher to find political content of interest
- employ models to learn from content (audio and commentary)
- use generative models taught in political psychology to make balanced responses such as raising questions, effectively breaking orthodoxy

__Problems__

- how has the distribution of political views evolved in the Hungarian population?
- can the distribution in public commentary on social media and online media platforms be changed by intervention?

__Background__

Hungary, and its current prime minister, is known for

- decreasing press freedom[^1]
- blocking EU in pledging support for Ukraine amidst the war with Russia[^2] and reaffirming ties with Russia[^3]
- getting EU funds while challenging EU's founding values[^4] [^5]
- maintaining cross-atlantic relations with the 45th president of the US seeking re-election in November, 2024[^6].
